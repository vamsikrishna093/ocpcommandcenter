# Monitors

## Overview

Monitors track a single numeric server metric over time. Each monitor points to one value in the live server data, casts it to a specific data type (integer, float, bytes, seconds, or milliseconds), and xyOps stores the samples in a time-series database. Monitors power the per-server and per-group graphs, and they can be used to trigger alerts.

- A monitor evaluates its expression once per minute on each matching server.
- Results are stored and graphed at multiple resolutions (hourly, daily, monthly, yearly).
- Alerts can reference monitor values and their computed deltas when needed.
- Several stock monitors ship with xyOps, and you can define your own.

- Data model: [Monitor](data.md#monitor) and [ServerMonitorData](data.md#servermonitordata)
- Plugins: [Monitor Plugins](plugins.md#monitor-plugins)
- Alerts: [Alerts](alerts.md)


## How It Works

Every minute each satellite sends a fresh [ServerMonitorData](data.md#servermonitordata) snapshot to the primary conductor. For every monitor whose group scope matches the server:

1. xyOps evaluates the monitor's source expression against the current server monitor data sample.
2. The value is type-cast using the monitor's data type and optional match regex.
3. If the monitor is configured as a delta monitor, its rate is computed from the previous absolute value (and optionally divided by elapsed seconds).
4. The value is inserted into the server's time-series for all resolutions.

Notes:

- Monitor expressions run against the live ServerMonitorData context only. They do not depend on other monitors.
- Alerts evaluate immediately after monitors are computed, and can reference both absolute monitor values and computed deltas.
- Group scoping allows a monitor to run only on specific server groups. Leave groups blank to apply to all.


## Creating and Editing Monitors

Go to Admin → Monitors.

- **Title**: Display name for the graph.
- **Display**: Toggle to show/hide graph in the UI without deleting it.
- **Icon**: Optional Material Design Icon displayed next to the title.
- **Server Groups**: Restrict evaluation to specific groups (optional).
- **Data Expression**: An expression that extracts or computes a single numeric value from ServerMonitorData. See [Expressions](#expressions).
- **Data Match**: Optional regular expression to extract a number from a string value. See [Data Match](#data-match).
- **Data Type**: Controls parsing and display (integer, float, bytes, seconds, milliseconds).
- **Delta Features**: For counter-style sources, compute a delta and optionally divide by elapsed time to get a rate per second; also supports a zero-minimum clamp.
- **Min Vert Range**: Set a minimum Y-axis range (e.g., 100 for percentages).
- **Data Suffix**: Optional unit shown in labels (e.g. %, /sec, ms).

Tips:

- Use the "Test..." button to evaluate your expression on a live server before saving.
- Click the search icon to open the Server Data Explorer and browse live ServerMonitorData paths.
- You can import/export monitors as JSON (see the stock examples below).


## Monitoring Data Flow

- **Sampling cadence**: Once per minute per server.
- **Storage**: Samples are down-sampled into four systems: hourly, daily, monthly, yearly.
- **Deltas**: For counter-style metrics (e.g., OS network bytes, disk bytes read/written), enable "Calc as Delta" and "Divide by Time" to graph rates per second.
- **Alert context**: After monitors are computed, xyOps evaluates alert triggers against the same data.


## Expressions

Monitor expressions are evaluated in [xyOps Expression Syntax](xyexp.md), using the current [ServerMonitorData](data.md#servermonitordata) object as context.  This uses JavaScript-style syntax with dot paths, array indexing, arithmetic and boolean operators.

Examples:

- Basic metric: `cpu.currentLoad` (CPU usage as a float percentage)
- Array index: `load[0]` (1-minute load average)
- Object path: `stats.network.conns` (current active connections)
- Math/composition: `100 - memory.available / memory.total * 100` (memory used %)
- Guarded math: `stats && stats.network ? stats.network.rx_bytes : 0` (coalesce missing to 0)

Guidelines:

- Expressions must resolve to a single numeric value before final casting.
- The evaluation context is the [ServerMonitorData](data.md#servermonitordata) for the current minute. Do not reference `monitors.*` or `deltas.*` in monitor expressions.
- For complex or custom metrics, consider a [Monitor Plugin](plugins.md#monitor-plugins) that can emit data into `commands`, and extract a number via expression (and optionally `data_match`).

## Data Match

If your expression yields a string and the number is embedded within it, set `Data Match` to a regular expression to extract exactly one numeric value. If the regex includes a capture group, the first group is used; otherwise the entire match is used.

Example (default "Open Files" monitor):

- Expression: `commands.open_files`
- Data Match: `(\d+)`
- Result: Extracts the first integer from a string like `"1056\t0\t9223372036854775807"`.


## Delta Monitors

Some data sources are absolute counters that only ever increase, such as OS network byte totals or disk I/O byte counters. For these:

- **Calc as Delta**: Stores the change since the previous minute instead of the absolute counter.
- **Divide by Time**: Divides the delta by elapsed seconds between samples to produce a per-second rate.
- **Zero Minimum**: Clamp negative spikes to a specific minimum (commonly `0`) to avoid dips after reboots or counter resets.

Alerts can also reference delta values via the `deltas` object. See [Alert Expressions](alerts.md#alert-expressions).


## Default Monitors

xyOps ships with a set of standard monitors. Here is what each tracks:

- **Load Average**: `load[0]` -- 1-minute load average (float).
- **CPU Usage**: `cpu.currentLoad` -- CPU usage percentage (float), suffix `%`, min range `100`.
- **Memory in Use**: `memory.used` -- Total memory in use (bytes).
- **Memory Available**: `memory.available` -- Available memory (bytes).
- **Network Connections**: `stats.network.conns` -- Active socket connections (integer).
- **Disk Usage**: `mounts.root.use` -- Root filesystem usage percentage (float), suffix `%`, min range `100`.
- **Disk Read**: `stats.fs.rx` -- Disk bytes read, as a delta divided by time (bytes/sec). Enable: Calc as Delta, Divide by Time, Zero Minimum.
- **Disk Write**: `stats.fs.wx` -- Disk bytes written, as a delta divided by time (bytes/sec). Enable: Calc as Delta, Divide by Time, Zero Minimum.
- **Disk I/O**: `stats.io.tIO` -- Total disk I/O ops per second (integer). Enable: Calc as Delta, Divide by Time, Zero Minimum.
- **I/O Wait**: `cpu.totals.iowait` -- CPU I/O wait percentage (float, Linux only), suffix `%`, min range `100`.
- **Open Files**: `commands.open_files` with `Data Match` `(\d+)` -- Number of open files (integer, Linux only).
- **Network In**: `stats.network.rx_bytes` -- Network bytes in per second (bytes/sec). Enable: Calc as Delta, Divide by Time, Zero Minimum.
- **Network Out**: `stats.network.tx_bytes` -- Network bytes out per second (bytes/sec). Enable: Calc as Delta, Divide by Time, Zero Minimum.
- **Processes**: `processes.all` -- Total number of processes (integer).
- **Active Jobs**: `jobs` -- Number of active xyOps jobs on the server (integer).

Use these as templates for your own monitors, or create more from scratch. You can also import/export monitors as JSON files.


## QuickMon

QuickMon (Quick Monitors) are lightweight, predefined real-time monitors sampled every second on each server. They are meant for "right now" visibility and short-term trend lines on server and group pages.

- **Presets**: CPU load/usage, memory used/available, disk read/write bytes/sec, network in/out bytes/sec.
- **Retention**: The last 60 seconds per server is stored in memory.
- **Display**: Real-time graphs and gauges on Server and Group pages. New samples stream live via websockets.
- **Snapshots**: The most recent 60-second series is embedded into all server and group snapshots.
- **Config**: Definitions live in `config.json` under [quick_monitors](config.md#quick_monitors). Each preset includes `id`, `source` path (from the per-second agent data), `type` (integer/float/bytes), and optional delta/time options mirroring monitor behavior.

QuickMon complements minute-level monitors: use QuickMon for immediate visibility, and standard monitors for historical analysis and alerting.


## Examples and Recipes

- **Track Specific Process Memory**
  - Expression: `processes.list[.command == 'ffmpeg'].memRss` *(exact name match)*
  - Expression: `find( processes.list, 'command', 'ffmpeg' ).memRss` *(substring match)*
  - Type: `bytes`
- **Memory Used %**
  - Expression: `100 - memory.available / memory.total * 100`
  - Type: `float`, Suffix: `%`, Min Vert Range: `100`.
- **Root Free Space (in GB)**
  - Expression: `(mounts.root.available) / (1024 * 1024 * 1024)`
  - Type: `float`, Suffix: `GB`.
- **TCP LISTEN Sockets**
  - Expression: `count( conns[.state == 'LISTEN'] )`
  - Or alternatively: `stats.network.states.listen`
  - Type: `integer`.

If your expression returns a string (e.g., a custom command output), use "Data Match" to extract the number. For advanced metrics, write a [Monitor Plugin](plugins.md#monitor-plugins) that emits structured data, then point a monitor expression at it.
